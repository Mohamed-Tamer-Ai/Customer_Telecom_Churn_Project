## 🎯 Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom companies. This project develops a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can reduce customer attrition and improve revenue retention.

### Why Customer Churn Prediction Matters

- **Cost Efficiency**: Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retaining existing ones
- **Revenue Protection**: Identify at-risk customers before they leave
- **Targeted Marketing**: Optimize retention campaigns for high-risk segments
- **Customer Insights**: Understand factors driving customer dissatisfaction

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Comprehensive EDA**: In-depth exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic regression classifier for churn prediction
- 🎨 **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly Streamlit web application
- 📈 **Real-time Predictions**: Input customer data and get instant churn probability
- 📉 **Data Preprocessing**: Robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saved model for quick deployment and inference

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a telecom customer churn dataset containing:

- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, age, partner status, dependents
- **Account Information**: Tenure, contract type, payment method, billing preferences
- **Service Usage**: Phone service, internet service, online security, technical support, etc.
- **Financial Data**: Monthly charges, total charges
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

### Key Statistics
- Multiple features capturing customer behavior and service subscriptions
- Includes both categorical and numerical variables
- Real-world telecom customer data patterns

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
